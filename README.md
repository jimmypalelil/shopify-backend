Shopify Backend Challenge

**An Express Server App where images can be searched for with descriptive queries**

To start NodeJS Express Server
> npm i --save

> npm run start

go to http://localhost:3000/search?q=... in your browser and type in search query after "q="

This will display the images

Right now only three images are in the repository.

Try query terms: 'sand', 'snow', 'beach', 'mountain'


**PS: In Production/real-life scenario, this data would be hosted on a cloud database (preferably NoSQL database like
MongoDB/DynamoDB) and the metadata would be cached on the server for fast lookup (just like in this project)**
